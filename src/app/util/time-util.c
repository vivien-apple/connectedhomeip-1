/** @brief Get Current Time
 *
 * This callback is called when device attempts to get current time from the
 * hardware. If this device has means to retrieve exact time, then this method
 * should implement it. If the callback can't provide the exact time it should
 * return 0 to indicate failure. Default action is to return 0, which indicates
 * that device does not have access to real time.
